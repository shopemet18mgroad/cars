AucJunction is considered as third party not particularly interested in the item/s being sold/bought on behalf of the seller/buyer.<br><br>
            
            
            <strong>DEFINITIONS</strong><br>

            <strong>2. BIDDER -</strong> Any legal entity who is registered with AucJunction and who makes or places a bid on the website to buy/sell the assets either in part or in full is considered as a Bidder. An individual can represent as a bidder on his own behalf and on behalf of other legal entities, provided he registers with AucJunction separately in those capacities.

            <strong>6. ONLINE BIDDING EVENT -</strong> An Online Bidding Event is a process for price determination through competitive interaction between Bidders on the website. Online Bidding Events initiated by the Seller are known as Forward Auctions and those initiated by the Buyers are known as Reverse Auctions.<br>

            <strong>8.</strong> You are bound by these terms and conditions, including those specific to a particular online auction event<br><br>
            
            <strong>MODIFICATIONS TO WEBSITE, SERVICES AND TERMS AND CONDITIONS</strong><br>
            
            AucJunction reserves the right to modify, amend, suspend or discontinue any aspect of the services or the website at any time without notice.<br><br>
            
            AucJunction reserves the right to amend any, or all the terms and conditions without notice at any time at its sole discretion and announce the same on the website.

            <strong>PASSWORD AND SECURITY</strong><br>
            
            After you register with AucJunction on the website, you will be allotted a unique user identification (User ID) by AucJunction and you will be prompted to enter a password. This is the log in password. The password is a string of characters (combination of alpha, numeric & special characters) used to authenticate your identity and provide access to various resources on the website. The length of your log in password must be a minimum of eight characters and has to be a combination of alpha and numeric characters. You can also include special characters to strengthen your log in password. However the following special characters ( ~ . / , ? < > : ; ' \" + = _ - ^ ) are not allowed and will be ignored. The User is solely responsible for all use and for maintaining and protecting the confidentiality of their User ID and password<br><br>
            
            <strong>FORGOT PASSWORD</strong><br>
            
            In case you forget the log in password, the only way you can change your log in password is by clicking on the "Lost Password" link on the home page of the website.

            <strong>TRANSACTION PASSWORD</strong><br>
            
            To have an additional layer of security, Bidders participating in auctions must set up a transaction password.

It shall be the endeavour of AucJunction to ensure that the Server Time reflects as closely as possible the Indian Standard Time (IST) i.e. UTC + 05.30 hrs. However, in the event of any deviations between the Server Time and the Indian Standard Time, the functioning of the Auction Engine (including Start, Operation & closure of auctions) would be guided by the Server Time. Bidders participating in the auctions are advised to refresh the right-side window of the Auction room to check the exact Server Time that is displayed there.<br>
            
            <strong>TERMS OF AGREEMENT</strong>

            <strong>1.1</strong> Participation and bidding in the auctions on the website shall be treated as conclusive evidence of the fact that the Bidder has inspected the assets and the related documents pertaining to the auction, and is satisfied in all respects regarding the quality, quantity, condition of the assets, taxes and duties, and other extraneous factors and the Principle of Caveat Emptor (let the Bidder beware) will apply. It shall also imply that the Bidder has carefully gone through the terms and conditions, including amendments, if any, prevailing at the time of the auction.
            No objections or complaints will be entertained once the bid is placed.<br>
            
            <strong>1.2</strong> All assets sold/bought on the website are on "AS IS WHERE IS BASIS" and "NO COMPLAINT BASIS".<br>
            
            <strong>1.3</strong> AucJunction does not give warranty or guarantee of the quality, quantity, measurement, condition, and chemical composition of the assets and about its "End Use" or fitness for a particular purpose.<br>
            
            <strong>1.4</strong> The highest/lowest Bidder does not get any right to demand acceptance of his bid/offer. Seller/Buyer reserves the right to accept/reject/cancel any bid/offer, withdraw any portion of the assets at any stage from auction, even after acceptance of bid/offer, issue of delivery order/purchase order without assigning any reason thereof. In the event of such rejection, cancellation or withdrawal, the Seller/Buyer shall not be responsible for any damages/loss to the successful bidder on account of such rejection, cancellation or withdrawal.<br><br>
            
            <strong>2.0 COMMUNICATION</strong><br>
            
            <strong>2.1</strong> User consents to receive communication from AucJunction by electronic mail, short messaging services on their mobile phones, by phone calls or through posting notices posted on the website. User fully understands that this consent to receive communication shall override their registration on the NDNC, if any.<br>

            <strong>3.1</strong> Multiple Log in from same IP Address - Bidders participating in the auctions may please note that multiple login from the same IP Address will not be permitted.<br>
            
            <strong>3.2</strong> Time Extension - If any market-leading bid (bid higher/lower than the highest/lowest at the point in time) is received in the last three minutes of closing time, the closing time will be extended automatically by three minutes. Please note, Time Extension as mentioned in the bidding room will apply and three minutes is only an example.<br>
            
            <strong>3.3</strong> Bids - All bids placed are legally valid bids and are to be considered as bids from the Bidder himself. Once the bid is placed, the Bidders cannot modify or withdraw the bid for whatever any reason. The highest/lowest and the latest bid on the auction shall supersede all the previous bids of the Bidder. Bidders may please note that in the event of a manual bid amount matching that of an auto bid, the manual bid will prevail and be considered.<br><br>
            
            <strong>3.4 Auto Bid:</strong><br>
            
            <strong>a.</strong> Auto Bid facility is provided for bidders intending to place a maximum/minimum value for a lot/lots.<br>
            
            <strong>b.</strong> Auto Bid is not a confirmed bid. It is only the maximum ceiling amount/minimum floor amount set by the bidder to enable the auction engine to place bids on his behalf, whenever he is outbid, up to the ceiling/floor amount set by him.<br>
            
            <strong>c.</strong> Once an Auto Bid is set, the auction engine will consider the ceiling/floor amount for the next possible bid only, depending on the highest/lowest bid prevailing at that point of time and the increment/decrement amount prescribed for that lot. However, Auto Bid cannot be set for amounts less than two increments/decrements to the highest/lowest bid prevailing at that point of time.<br>
            
            <strong>d.</strong> Bidders may please note that in the event of a manual bid amount matching that of an Auto Bid, the manual bid will prevail and be considered.<br><br>
