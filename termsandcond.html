                <p class="aboutus-text">Welcome to AucJunction.com website (hereinafter referred to as "the website").
<br><br>

to as "AucJunction") on the website.
<br><br>
AucJunction is an e-commerce service provider mandated by the seller/buyer to facilitate
virtual auctions by the seller/buyer. The website is an online auction platform, a virtual
marketplace/venue for sellers/buyers to conduct sale/purchase of assets, and for bidders to
make/place bids/offers on such assets. AucJunction is considered as third party not
particularly interested in the item/s being sold/bought on behalf of the seller/buyer.<br><br>
<span class="fontbld">DEFINITIONS</span><br><br>

<span class="fontbld">1. SELLER/BUYER - SELLER/BUYER</span> - Seller/Buyer referred to in this agreement is any real
individual or legal entity who wishes to sell/buy his/her/its assets through internet driven online
auctions on the website and who has mandated AucJunction to provide the website and other
related support services.<br><br>

<span class="fontbld">2. BIDDER - </span> Any legal entity who is registered with AucJunction and who makes or places a
bid on the website to buy/sell the assets either in part or in full is considered as a Bidder. An
individual can represent as a bidder on his own behalf and on behalf of other legal entities,
provided he registers with AucJunction separately in those capacities. A successful Bidder is
that Bidder in whose name the sale certificate or purchase order is issued by the Seller/Buyer.<br><br>

<span class="fontbld">3. PAID MEMBER - </span>Any Bidder who pays the annual membership fee as prescribed by
AucJunction is a paid member.<br><br>

<span class="fontbld">4.USER - </span>Any legal entity who uses the website and/or the related services provided by
AucJunction is considered as a User.<br><br>

<span class="fontbld">5. AGREEMENT - </span>The terms and conditions, together with any additional terms and conditions
specific to an online auction event on the website (which can be found through one or more
links on the website for the auction in question) constitute the Agreement.<br><br>

<span class="fontbld">6. ONLINE BIDDING EVENT - </span>An Online Bidding Event is a process for price determination
through competitive interaction between Bidders on the website. Online Bidding Events initiated
by the Seller are known as Forward Auctions and those initiated by the Buyers are known as
Reverse Auctions.<br><br>

<span class="fontbld">7. </span>On accessing the website or using the services provided by AucJunction or by registering
either as a Buyer/ Seller / User you agree that you have read the General Terms and
Conditions, including the terms and conditions specific to an online auction event.<br><br>

<span class="fontbld">8. </span>You are bound by these terms and conditions, including those specific to a particular online
auction event<br><br>

<span class="fontbld">MODIFICATIONS TO WEBSITE, SERVICES AND TERMS AND CONDITIONS</span><br><br>
AucJunction reserves the right to modify, amend, suspend or discontinue any aspect of the
services or the website at any time without notice.<br><br>

AucJunction reserves the right to amend any, or all the terms and conditions without notice at
any time at its sole discretion and announce the same on the website. Accessing the website
and/or using the services shall constitute acceptance of the terms and conditions including the
amendments.<br><br>
<span class="fontbld">PASSWORD AND SECURITY</span><br><br>
After you register with AucJunction on the website, you will be allotted a unique user
identification (User ID) by AucJunction and you will be prompted to enter a password. This is
the log in password. The password is a string of characters (combination of alpha, numeric &amp;
special characters) used to authenticate your identity and provide access to various resources
on the website. The length of your log in password must be a minimum of eight characters and
has to be a combination of alpha and numeric characters. You can also include special
characters to strengthen your log in password. However the following special characters ( ~ . / ,
? &lt; &gt; : ; ' \" + = _ - ^ ) are not allowed and will be ignored. The User is solely responsible for all
use and for maintaining and protecting the confidentiality of their User ID and password<br><br>

<span class="fontbld">FORGOT PASSWORD</span><br><br>
In case you forget the log in password, the only way you can change your log in password is by
clicking on the "Reset Password" link on the home page of the website. You will receive a
verification code on your registered e-mail address and your registered mobile phone. Using the
verification code, you can change your log in password.<br><br>
<!-- <span class="fontbld">TRANSACTION PASSWORD</span></br></br>
To have an additional layer of security, Bidders participating in auctions must set up a
transaction password. Participating bidders must enter this transaction password to authenticate
their entry into the virtual auction room and place their bids. Bidders can set their transaction
password and must confirm the same with the OTP that will be sent to their registered mobile
number and their registered e-mail ID. Transaction password is session specific.</br></br>
 -->
<span class="fontbld">TIME</span><br><br>
Time wherever mentioned in any page of the website refers to Indian Standard Time (IST) i.e.
UTC + 05.30 hrs. All the timings of the Online Bid shall be based on the time indicated by the
Server hosting the Auction Engine. It shall be the endeavour of AucJunction to ensure that the
Server Time reflects as closely as possible the Indian Standard Time (IST) i.e. UTC + 05.30 hrs.
However, in the event of any deviations between the Server Time and the Indian Standard
Time, the functioning of the Auction Engine (including Start, Operation &amp; closure of auctions)
would be guided by the Server Time.<br><br>

website and its services. AucJunction provides the online auction platform wherein the users
can sell, purchase, bid and buy, or bid and sell the assets listed on the website pursuant to the
terms and conditions set forth below.<br><br>

<span class="fontbld">1.0 GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS</span><br><br>
<span class="fontbld">1.1 </span>Participation and bidding in the auctions on the website shall be treated as
conclusive evidence of the fact that the Bidder has inspected the assets and the related
documents pertaining to the auction, and is satisfied in all respects regarding the quality,
quantity, condition of the assets, taxes and duties, and other extraneous factors and the
Principle of Caveat Emptor (let the Bidder beware) will apply. It shall also imply that the
Bidder has carefully gone through the terms and conditions, including amendments, if
any, prevailing at the time of the auction.<br>
No objections or complaints will be entertained once the bid is placed.<br><br>
<span class="fontbld">1.2 </span>All assets sold/bought on the website are on "AS IS WHERE IS BASIS" and "NO
COMPLAINT BASIS".<br><br>

point in time) is received in the last three minutes of closing time, the closing time will be
extended automatically by five minutes. Please note, Time Extension as mentioned in the
bidding room will apply and three minutes is only an example.<br><br>
<span class="fontbld">3.3 Bids - </span>All bids placed are legally valid bids and are to be considered as bids from the Bidder
himself. Once the bid is placed, the Bidders cannot modify or withdraw the bid for whatever any
reason. The highest/lowest and the latest bid on the auction shall supersede all the previous
bids of the Bidder. Bidders may please note that in the event of a manual bid amount matching
that of an auto bid, the manual bid will prevail and be considered.<br><br>

<span class="fontbld">a. </span>Auto Bid facility is provided for bidders intending to place a maximum/minimum value for a
lot/lots.<br><br>
<span class="fontbld">b. </span>Auto Bid is not a confirmed bid. It is only the maximum ceiling amount/minimum floor amount
set by the bidder to enable the auction engine to place bids on his behalf, whenever he is
outbid, up to the ceiling/floor amount set by him.<br><br>
<span class="fontbld">c. </span>Once an Auto Bid is set, the auction engine will consider the ceiling/floor amount for the next
possible bid only, depending on the highest/lowest bid prevailing at that point of time and the
increment/decrement amount prescribed for that lot. However, Auto Bid cannot be set for
amounts less than two increments/decrements to the highest/lowest bid prevailing at that point
of time.<br><br>
<span class="fontbld">d.</span> Bidders may please note that in the event of a manual bid amount matching that of an Auto
Bid, the manual bid will prevail and be considered.<br><br>
